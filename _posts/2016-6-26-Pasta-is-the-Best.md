# Pasta 

Thank God for the person who discovered this delicacy. I mean where do i even start, pasta and meatballs is the greatest innovation. Ok i lied there, proggramming is the greatest invention. Invention, innovation. English is not one of my strongholds. Anyway, leave alone the inventions of this world, pasta is from another planet altogether. Ok since i have moved to amazing things that are out of this world, i guess have to mention Lionel Messi. you cant say the words out of this world without his name coming up. Ok now that am done with that shitty Barca player, i'll come back to pasta. i think it was probably invented in spain. which will probably take me back to speaking about football but hey, you cant really expect me to speak entirely about pasta. If you want pasta only please stay away from this blog.
If you read Spain and are still on this blog, what are you doing with your life. Pasta is the staple food for people in Italy.Piccolo bastardo
The first reference to pasta, in a book, was in 1154. And the first reference in a blog, well lets just say you really dont wanna know how many hungry bloggers are out there. 
 The best ranked food blog is actually at no. 2953. so any hopes of this blog making it anywhere are high dont you think? i mean who else has ever talked about pasta like I/me. (English! English! tsk! tsk!) 
 Position 1 for pasta anyone?

## The Pasta 
Where did the word pasta come from. and 2 seconds later google gives me the world. No one really cares where it came from. you probably just wanna know where it ends up,  in that filthy stomach of yours, where else. 
By now, someone may have realised that i really dont wanna talk about pasta. i was just hungry at the time. and to be frank, seeing the word pasta is probably what made you open this blog. Just another hungry maniach like me. unlike me however (those words should not be used together, but hey am from Africa, What you gonna do about it. Hella Outta my Face) you are probably a fat Bastard. You have a problem with me using the B word, go watch Game Of Thrones. Ok if you havent watched it, my use of the word is Justified.

### Food for Thought
 There are many varieties of pasta, such as: long pasta, short pasta, minute pasta, egg pasta, fresh pasta and al forno pasta. which one caught your eye? I really dont care.
  Egg pasta contains egg. I feel so smart after saying that. Am not going to write some long ass sh** about how to prepare pasta, but the beauty is how to know if it is ready.If pasta is cooked properly, it should stick to a wall when it is thrown. How amazing is that. "Hey Mum is the food ready?" "Why dont you stick it up the wall you cunt" Yes a dream convo for many moms out there.
  Come to think of it, Pasta has become an interesting topic after all.

  #### How to make pasta
  Ok on a serious note, How does one make Pasta. well, dont worry i got you!! In Greek mythology, it is believed that the god Vulcan invented a device that made strings of dough. This was the earliest reference to a pasta maker. Dear Vulcan, please make this little puta that device. Coz i sure as hell aint telling them how to make pasta. Google that sh**

  ##### Fun facts

  1.Uncooked dry pasta can be kept for up to a year. Who keeps pasta for a year? I know i cant. That fact aint fun after all. 

  2.Cooked pasta can be frozen and re-eaten within three months. Now thats something i wanted to hear. Hunger you shall never find me. No food in the world, Well hello i got pasta in the freezer.

  3.It was traditionally eaten by hand. Well, come to think of it, it probably tastes better eaten by hand, but what do I know. Am just another traditionalist minding my Business.

  4.October is National Pasta Month. Do i really have to mention the Month i was born, but if I must. Just ask Drake. Dear Mr. Drake Sir THANK YOU for VIEWS. 

  5.The National Pasta Association is a worldwide group which enjoys eating and discussing pasta, and its history. If you think i aint a member of that Association, you should probably google my name. Let me save you the trouble
